This directory contains an example tool demonstrating the use of LZscan
algorithm.

Below is an example session assuming there is a file named 'data' in the
examples/ directory.


# Compilation

# Compute the size of LZ77 parsing with a block length equal to
# 1MiB, i.e. using roughly n + 27 * 2^20 bytes of main memory.
> ./count data 1
